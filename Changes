0.94 Monday, December 29, 2014

    again, sorry about this.

0.90 Saturday, Feb. 8th, 2014
  - !!
  - BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY WARNING   !!
  - !!
  - This is the first step towards full !!
  - compatibility with the Promises/A+				    !!
  - spec, at which we will declare this !!
  - to be module to be 1.0  !!
  - NOTE: Pretty much everything in this release is thanks to the work of
    Clinton Gormley++
  - Fixed the behavior of finally() to make sure @results are passed along
    correctly
  - Handle any "then"-able object to be returned as a result, instead of
    only accepting Promise objects
  - then/done/finally now accept both callbacks (CODE refs) and "Callable"
    objects (objects of classes that overload the CODE de-ref operator)
  - New docs in Promises::Cookbook::GentleIntro.
  - Doc fixes and CPAN repository metadata added, thanks to David
    Steinbrunner for this

0.08 Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014
  - Thanks to clinton gormley for all these
  - changes. Please take note of the backcompat
  - breaking change for finalize().
  - then() callbacks are now wrapped in an eval block to prevent fatal
    exceptions and to ensure that rejected promises are propagated
    correctly
  - renamed finalize() to done()
  - added catch() sugar which takes just an error handler
  - added finally() handler which will always be called, regardles of
    whether the promise is resolved or rejected, much like
    try/catch/finally

0.07 Saturday, Jan. 18, 2014
  - fixing a issues with localizing exceptions that were found by CPAN
    testers - thanks to clinton gormley for providing the fix for this

0.06 Friday, Jan. 17, 2014
  - make sure to clear both resolved and rejected callbacks after
    resolution, thanks to clinton gormley for this.
  - add event-loop specific backends to allow promises to be resolved in an
    async manner (as Promises/A+ suggests) - thanks to clinton gormley for
    starting this feature - backend created for AE, AnyEvent and EV -
    backend for Mojo::IOLoop, thanks to clinton gormley for this - tests
    added
  - add in finalize() operator for ending a chain of promises (see docs for
    more info) - thanks to clinton gormley for this feature, docs and tests

0.05 Monday, Dec. 23, 2013
  - catch exceptions in any callback and call reject if they happen
  - the 'promise' method on deferred objects will now return a new
    Promises::Promise instance each time it is called - this prevents the
    memory cycle we originally had

0.04 Thursday, Oct. 17, 2013
  - DEPRECATION WARNING ***
  - The 'when' helper in Promises.pm is being deprecated because it clashes
    with the perl keyword. See RT #84024 for more info.
  - 'when' renamed to 'collect' - tests and docs adjusted accordingly

0.03 Sunday, Feb. 17th, 2013
  - added a `deferred` helper function to Promises.pm
  - fixed the reject call in `when` (thanks to rafl for this) - added tests
    for this
  - large doc reworking - moved things into a cookbook - added example of
    usage with Mojo::IOLoop - added comparison with Scala futures - this
    still needs some work, but the basics are ther

0.02 Saturday, Nov. 24th, 2012
  - add several predicate methods to help when interrogating status, this
    resolves RT #81278. - thanks to Toby Inkster for this
  - fixed error chaining so that the result of an error in one step of the
    chain will be passed onto the next step as well, this resolves RT
    #81358. - thanks to TOSHIOITO for this
  - made error callbacks optional and ensured that the errors will bubble
    to the next promise in the chain, this resolves RT #81356. - thanks
    again to TOSHIOITO for this

0.01 Friday, Nov. 16th, 2012
