0.90 Saturday, Feb. 8th, 2014
 - !!
 - BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY WARNING   !!
 - !!
 - This is the first step towards full !!
 - compatibility with the Promises/A+ !!
 - spec, at which we will declare this !!
 - to be module to be 1.0  !!
 - NOTE: Pretty much everything in this release is thanks to the work of
   Clinton Gormley++
 - Fixed the behavior of finally() to make sure @results are passed along
   correctly
 - Handle any "then"-able object to be returned as a result, instead of
   only accepting Promise objects
 - then/done/finally now accept both callbacks (CODE refs) and "Callable"
   objects (objects of classes that overload the CODE de-ref operator)
 - New docs in Promises::Cookbook::GentleIntro.
 - Doc fixes and CPAN repository metadata added, thanks to David
   Steinbrunner for this

0.08 Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014
 - Thanks to clinton gormley for all these
 - changes. Please take note of the backcompat
 - breaking change for finalize().
 - then() callbacks are now wrapped in an eval block to prevent fatal
   exceptions and to ensure that rejected promises are propagated correctly
 - renamed finalize() to done()
 - added catch() sugar which takes just an error handler
 - added finally() handler which will always be called, regardles of
   whether the promise is resolved or rejected, much like try/catch/finally

0.07 Saturday, Jan. 18, 2014
 - fixing a issues with localizing exceptions that were found by CPAN
   testers - thanks to clinton gormley for providing the fix for this

0.06 Friday, Jan. 17, 2014
 - make sure to clear both resolved and rejected callbacks after
   resolution, thanks to clinton gormley for this.
 - add event-loop specific backends to allow promises to be resolved in an
   async manner (as Promises/A+ suggests) - thanks to clinton gormley for
   starting this feature - backend created for AE, AnyEvent and EV -
   backend for Mojo::IOLoop, thanks to clinton gormley for this - tests
   added
 - add in finalize() operator for ending a chain of promises (see docs for
   more info) - thanks to clinton gormley for this feature, docs and tests

0.05 Monday, Dec. 23, 2013
 - catch exceptions in any callback and call reject if they happen
 - the 'promise' method on deferred objects will now return a new
   Promises::Promise instance each time it is called - this prevents the
   memory cycle we originally had

0.04 Thursday, Oct. 17, 2013
 - DEPRECATION WARNING ***
 - The 'when' helper in Promises.pm is being deprecated because it clashes
   with the perl keyword. See RT #84024 for more info.
 - 'when' renamed to 'collect' - tests and docs adjusted accordingly

0.03 Sunday, Feb. 17th, 2013
 - added a `deferred` helper function to Promises.pm
 - fixed the reject call in `when` (thanks to rafl for this) - added tests
   for this
 - large doc reworking - moved things into a cookbook - added example of
   usage with Mojo::IOLoop - added comparison with Scala futures - this
   still needs some work, but the basics are ther

0.02 Saturday, Nov. 24th, 2012
 - add several predicate methods to help when interrogating status, this
   resolves RT #81278. - thanks to Toby Inkster for this
 - fixed error chaining so that the result of an error in one step of the
   chain will be passed onto the next step as well, this resolves RT
   #81358. - thanks to TOSHIOITO for this
 - made error callbacks optional and ensured that the errors will bubble to
   the next promise in the chain, this resolves RT #81356. - thanks again
   to TOSHIOITO for this

0.01 Friday, Nov. 16th, 2012
