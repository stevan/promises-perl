## Promises

This is an implementation of the Promise pattern for Perl. The particular
API implemented is based on the [Promises/A proposal for Common JS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A).
The actual implementation is based heavily on the [YUI Deferred plugin](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/deferred).
