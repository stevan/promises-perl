# Before the pipe-based approach used below, there was an AE::postpone-based
# approach for _notify_backend. The current code is much more performant:

# Original code (on a laptop on battery power):
# Backend:  Promises::Deferred::AE
# Benchmark: running one, two for at least 10 CPU seconds...
#  one: 44 wallclock secs @ 3083.99/s (n=31210)
#  two: 29 wallclock secs @ 1723.66/s (n=17340)

# New approach:
# Backend:  Promises::Deferred::AE
# Benchmark: running one, two for at least 10 CPU seconds...
#  one: 11 wallclock secs @ 10457.90/s (n=108553)
#  two: 11 wallclock secs @ 3878.69/s (n=40959)

=head1 NAME

Promises::Deferred::AE - An implementation of Promises in Perl

=head1 VERSION

version 1.05

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Promises backend => ['AE'], qw[ deferred collect ];

    # ... everything else is the same

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The "Promise/A+" spec strongly suggests that the callbacks
given to C<then> should be run asynchronously (meaning in the
next turn of the event loop), this module provides support for
doing so using the L<AE> module.

Module authors should not care which event loop will be used but
instead should just the Promises module directly:

    package MyClass;

    use Promises qw(deferred collect);

End users of the module can specify which backend to use at the start of
the application:

    use Promises -backend => ['AE'];
    use MyClass;
